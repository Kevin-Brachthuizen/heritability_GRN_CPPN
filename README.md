# heritability_GRN_CPPN
This repository is used to store the code I used for my bachelor's thesis about the heritability of two genetic encodings for artificial evolution: Gene Regulatory Networks and Compositional Pattern Producing Networks.

behavioural_heritability_functions and morphological behavioural_heritability_functions both contain functions for their respective properties.
This includes calculations and the simpler visualizations.

For the remaining graphs, this was manually done when needed in Plotting1 and Plotting2. However, as this was done on the basis of need, the files were recycled to make multiple plots.
For this reason, not all code for the graphs is present in these files.

Heritabilities_OT is the code for plotting the heritabilities over all generations.

stats_tests contains the code that performs a number of statistical tests. The results are found in results_stats.

The datasets can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kevinbrachthuizen/grncppn-evolution-data/data and should be placed in a folder named 'experiments_data'
